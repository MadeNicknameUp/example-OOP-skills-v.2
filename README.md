This C++ project demonstrates the creation of a hierarchical data structure (a tree), where each branch can contain elves. The project uses r
ecursion to build the tree and search for neighbors of an elf by name. The code is implemented using OOP, dynamic memory, and STL, showcasing my 
skills in these areas and providing an example of my proficiency in C++.
